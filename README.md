## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing both slow and fast division algorithms in the field of computer architecture. The goal is to develop algorithms, code them in Verilog or VHDL, and analyze their functionality, performance, and efficiency. The project also involves synthesizing and implementing the designs, comparing them based on area, power, and speed, and drawing conclusions based on the results.

## Pre-requisites
- Digital Design knowledge
- HDL (Verilog or VHDL)
- Basic FPGA (optional) and Signal Processing knowledge

## Category
Simulation, Synthesis, and Implementation

## Semester
4th

## Description
A division algorithm is a mathematical process that calculates the quotient and/or remainder of two integers, given a dividend and divisor. For example, if the dividend (a) is 15 and the divisor (b) is 8, the quotient (q) is 1 and the remainder (r) is 7. This project aims to implement both slow and fast division algorithms to perform such calculations efficiently.

**Develop the Verilog/VHDL code:**

    ```verilog
    // Fast Division Algorithm Code
    // ...
    ```
    ```verilog
    // Slow Division Algorithm Code
    // ...
    ```
- **Synthesize and implement the designs:**
    - Functional simulation: Perform functional simulations to verify the correctness of the implemented designs.
    - RTL simulation: Conduct RTL simulations to evaluate the performance and functionality of the designs.
- **Compare the dividers based on their area, power, and speed:** Record and analyze the data related to area utilization, power consumption, and operational speed for the synthesized designs.
- **Tabulate the results:**
  
  | Algorithm        | Area   | Power    | Speed    |
  |------------------|--------|----------|----------|
  | Slow Division    | ...    | ...      | ...      |
  | Fast Division    | ...    | ...      | ...      |
  
- **Draw conclusions based on the design:** Evaluate the efficiency, performance, and trade-offs of the slow and fast division algorithms based on the analysis and comparison. Provide recommendations for future enhancements.
