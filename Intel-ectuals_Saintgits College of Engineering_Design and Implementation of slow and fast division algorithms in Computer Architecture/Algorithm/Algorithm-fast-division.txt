1. Set dividend_reg to the value of dividend
2. Set divisor_reg to the value of divisor
3. Set reciprocal to 16 divided by divisor_reg
4. Repeat 3 times:
     - Set product to reciprocal multiplied by divisor_reg
     - Set difference to dividend_reg minus product
     - Set scaled_difference to difference right-shifted by 4 bits
     - Set reciprocal to reciprocal plus scaled_difference
5. Set product to reciprocal multiplied by dividend_reg
6. Set quotient_reg to product right-shifted by 4 bits
7. Set quotient to quotient_reg
8. Set remainder to dividend minus (quotient_reg multiplied by divisor_reg)
